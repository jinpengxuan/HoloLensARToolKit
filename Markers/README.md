Marker Images for ARToolKit
===

Date: 2020-04-19

## Overview

These marker images are designed for [ARToolKit](http://artoolkit.org/) project. They can be also found **[HERE](https://github.com/artoolkit/ARToolKit5/tree/master/doc/patterns)**.

I made a copy of them here for easier reference. 

## How to use

These markers work with different samples in ```HoloLensARToolKit/Assets/Sample```.

For the cube marker and the multi-pattern marker, simply print them with the specific paper setting. Make sure the scale is **100%**.

For the **Hiro** and **Kanji** marker, print with **100%** scale will result into **80mm** marker size. For the samples, print with **50%** scale, or alternatively, you can change the marker size in sample scenes.

Other matrix code markers can be found in ARToolKit repository **[HERE](https://github.com/artoolkit/ARToolKit5/tree/master/doc/patterns)**.
